# Face-Recognition-Model-with-Gender-Age-and-Emotions-Estimations
Capstone Project by [Bertrand Lee](https://github.com/bertrandlee) and [Riley Kwok](https://github.com/rileykwok)

## Background
We created a prototype face recognition system based on three pretrained CNN models able to identify faces and predict the gender, age and emotions of persons in an image or video.
